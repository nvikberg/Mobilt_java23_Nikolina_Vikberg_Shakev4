Assignment 1: Shake
Create our own app that uses Sensor Event Listners and Sensor Manger to show accelerometer data

There is two activities(pages), first one holds progress bar UI components to show when user is moving the phone. 
If the user "shakes" the phone, a picture and a note will pop up.
User can click on button to switch activity to see actual numbers data on the second acitivity page, and then switch back to original page.
