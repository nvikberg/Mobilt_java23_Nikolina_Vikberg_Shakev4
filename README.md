### Nikolina Vikberg, Grit Academy Malm√∂

Assignment 1: Shake
Create our own app that uses Sensor Event Listners and Sensor Manger to show accelerometer data

How the app works: 
There are two activities(pages), first one holds progress bar (UI components) to show when user is moving the phone. 
If the user "shakes" the phone, a picture and a note will pop up along with a Toast message.
User can click on button to switch activity to see actual numbers data on the second acitivity page, and then switch back to original page.

User can move the phone and the progress bars will change
